# Introduction to R (intro_r)

Welcome to the **Introduction to R** repository! This small introduction is designed for students in Economics and beyond and gives some of the fundamentals of R programming, with a focus on data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using R and RStudio.

## Course Overview

This course will guide you through:

- **R and RStudio**: Installation, setup, and basic usage.
- **Data manipulation**: Using `dplyr` for filtering, selecting, and summarizing data.
- **Data wrangling**: Handling missing values, merging datasets, and reshaping data.
- **Data visualization**: Creating plots and graphs with `ggplot2`.

## Course Materials

The course materials are structured into the following sections:

1. **Introduction to R and RStudio**
   - Installing R and RStudio
   - Understanding the RStudio interface
   - Projects in RStudio
   - The R language

2. **Data Manipulation with dplyr**
   - Using verbs like `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, and `summarise()`
   - Piping with `%>%` and `|>` operators
   - Handling missing data

3. **Basic Data Analysis**
   - Descriptive statistics: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation
   - Grouped summaries with `group_by()`

4. **Data Visualization with ggplot2**
   - Creating bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots
   - Customizing plots: colors, labels, and themes

5. **Merging and Reshaping Data**
   - Joining datasets with `left_join()`, `inner_join()`
   - Reshaping data with `gather()` and `spread()`
